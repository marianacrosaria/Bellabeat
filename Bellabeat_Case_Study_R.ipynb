In this case study, I am a Junior Data Analyst and I am analyzing data from consumer's smart devices in order to gain insights on how they use them and look for growth opportunities for the company giving data-driven suggestions for a marketing strategy. \n\n### **The company**\n\nBellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women that was founded in 2013. It is a successful small company, but it has the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. They have been collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health to empower women with knowledge about their health and wellness.\n\n\n### **Ask and Prepare**:\n### **Business Task**\n\n* Analyze the data from the consumer's devices to understand how they are already using the tools.\n* Giving insights and suggestions for a new marketing strategy.\n\n### **Stakeholders**\n\n* Urška Sršen: Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* Sando Mur: Cofounder and part of Executive Team\n* The marketing analytics team\n\n### **Dataset Characteristics**\n\nThe data source that was provided for the this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius), on Kaggle. The dataset consists of 18 csv files containing 33 users health data logs from smart devices. The data was collected from users over a period of 2 months from 2016-03-12 to 2016-05-12, who consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.\n\nI will start by loading the necessary libraries for my analysis.","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"```{r Importing libraries}\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\")\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor)\n```","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And after downloading and storing the datasets I will import them to R Studio and name them.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"```{r Importing datasets}\n\ndaily_activity <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\ndaily_calories <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyCalories_merged.csv\")\ndaily_intensities <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv\")\ndaily_steps <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailySteps_merged.csv\")\nhourly_calories <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyCalories_merged.csv\")\nhourly_intensities <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv\")\nhourly_steps <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv\")\nminute_calories_narrow <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv\")\nminute_calories_wide <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv\")\nminute_intensities_narrow <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv\")\nminute_intensities_wide <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv\")\nminute_mets_narrow <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv\")\nminute_sleep <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteSleep_merged.csv\")\nminute_steps_narrow <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv\")\nminute_steps_wide <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteStepsWide_merged.csv\")\nsleep_day <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\nweight_log_info <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv\")\nheartrate_seconds <- read_csv(\"/cloud/project/Bellabeat/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv\")\n             \n```\n\n```{r Checking the sample size in each dataset}\n\nn_distinct(daily_activity$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_calories$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_intensities$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_steps$Id)\nn_distinct(hourly_calories$Id)\nn_distinct(hourly_intensities$Id)\nn_distinct(sleep_day$Id)\nn_distinct(weight_log_info$Id)\n\n```\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nAfter taking a peek at each dataset by clicking on them in the environment panel, I checked that the daily_activity dataset has a consolidated list of data from the other daily records, like daily steps, intensities and calories.
